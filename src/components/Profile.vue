        IÂ´m a experienced Frontend Engineer focused in delivering the maximum quality in his developed products.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the challenges to improve the sites I work on, learning new technologies and working with different teamates,
        learning new things from more experiences colleages and helping the less experienced ones to grow as professionals
        to give more value to the team/company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in clean coding, scrum values and communication between teams to get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend is full of great tools nowadays and the developers need to be mature enough
        to use them properly for their purposes, avoiding overengineering based on trends and focusing
        in using the right tools to reach their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that in frontend you should focus on the user, giving them lightning fast and usable
        pages, independently from his connection type, device or physical
        limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that the website should be accesible for everyone and the developers
        have the responsability of balance between the visual aspects and the usability.
